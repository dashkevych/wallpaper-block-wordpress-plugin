# Wallpaper Block Plugin for WordPress

This is the development repository for the Wallpaper Block plugin for WordPress, which provides a special block to create interactive backgrounds for your site.

## Getting Started

The Wallpaper Block plugin is currently in its alpha phase and is under review by WordPress.org, which means it's not available for direct installation from the official WordPress.org Plugin repository yet.

### Alpha Version Information

The alpha version of this plugin is the early testing phase aimed at catching bugs and design issues. It begins when the software is feature complete but likely contains several known or unknown bugs. Alpha software is not feature-complete and is released to a limited audience or internally. It's used to verify functionality and to detect significant issues early. Alpha versions are generally not stable and are expected to have more bugs and issues than later versions. We appreciate your feedback during this phase to help improve the product.

**Note**: Once reviewed and approved by WordPress.org, the plugin will transition to the beta phase, marking a more stable release closer to the final product.

### Download Instructions

**Important**: The name of the plugin's folder will change once it is hosted on WordPress.org. Currently, when you download the plugin directly from this GitHub repository, the folder name is `wbwp-main`. This is a default naming convention used by GitHub for repositories downloaded as ZIP files. However, when the plugin is installed directly from WordPress.org, the folder name will be `wallpaper-block`.

This difference is significant because WordPress identifies plugins based on their folder name. If you initially install the plugin from GitHub and later try to update it with a version from WordPress.org, you may end up with two separate instances of the plugin due to the differing folder names.

To avoid this issue, once the plugin is officially released on WordPress.org, you will need to **remove** the `wbwp-main` version and **install the plugin directly from WordPress.org**. This ensures that you will receive updates automatically and that the plugin remains in sync with the official release cycle.

After the plugin is available on WordPress.org, this repository will serve as a mirror source and a place for project management.

### Install Instructions

After downloading the ZIP file of the plugin:

1. Go to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Navigate to Plugins â†’ Add New.
3. Click on the 'Upload Plugin' button at the top of the page.
4. Choose the downloaded ZIP file.
5. Click 'Install Now' and wait for the installation to complete.
6. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
