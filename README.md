# Wallpaper Block Plugin for WordPress

This is the development repository for the Wallpaper Block plugin for WordPress, which provides a special block to create interactive backgrounds for your site.

## Getting Started

The Wallpaper Block plugin is currently in its alpha phase and is under review by WordPress.org. Consequently, it's not available for direct installation from the official WordPress.org Plugin repository yet.

### Alpha Version Information

The alpha version of this plugin represents the early testing phase where we aim to catch bugs and design issues. It begins when the software is feature complete but likely contains several known or unknown bugs. Alpha software is not feature-complete and is released to either a limited audience or internally. It's used to verify functionality and to detect significant issues early. Alpha versions are generally not stable and are expected to have more bugs and issues than later versions. We welcome your feedback during this phase to help us improve the product, fix bugs, and refine features.

**Note**: After the completion of the review process at the official WordPress.org plugin repository, the plugin will transition into the beta phase. This will mark a more stable release where the plugin is still being perfected but is more reflective of the final product.
